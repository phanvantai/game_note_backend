   - Emergency communication plan

### âš¡ Next Development Steps (After Risk Mitigation)

1. **PostgreSQL Setup** - Foundation database infrastructure

2. **Firebase Auth Middleware** - Secure token validation

3. **Database Schema** - Optimized for performance

4. **API Structure** - Clean architecture setup

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Git

### Installation

    1. Clone and navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd game_note_backend
    ```

    2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

    3. Run the server:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

    The server will start on port 8080 by default.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /hello` - Test endpoint returning a hello message

### Environment Variables

- `PORT` - Server port (default: 8080)

### Testing

Test the endpoints:

    ```bash
    # Health check
    curl http://localhost:8080/health

    # Hello endpoint
    curl http://localhost:8080/hello
    ```

## Development

### Project Structure

    ```bash
    game_note_backend/
    â”œâ”€â”€ main.go          # Main server file
    â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod           # Go module file
    â”œâ”€â”€ go.sum           # Go dependencies checksum
    â””â”€â”€ README.md        # This file
    ```

- Index frequently queried fields

### API Design Standards

- RESTful endpoints with consistent naming
- JSON request/response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error handling with structured error responses
